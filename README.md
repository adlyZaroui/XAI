# Comparative Analysis of XAI Methods for Medical Diagnostic using Chest X-ray Images

This repository contains a jupyter notebook for a project titled "Comparative Analysis of XAI Methods for Medical Diagnostic." The project focuses on exploring different Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for the diagnosis of pneumonia using chest X-ray images.

The dataset used is the chest x_ray dataset available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The main objective of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of three popular XAI methods: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and Integrated Gradients. These methods are applied to the VGG16 pre-trained model for pneumonia classification on the chest X-ray dataset.

The fine-tuning has been done following the procedure described here https://www.kaggle.com/code/marcosgois07/fine-tuning-with-vgg16-to-detection-of-pneumonia, and the model reached an accuracy of 75%.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to further enhance the project. Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests through GitHub.

By leveraging the power of XAI methods such as LIME, SHAP, and Integrated Gradients, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the interpretability and transparency of the pneumonia classification model. The comparative analysis of these XAI methods can contribute to the improvement of diagnostic accuracy in medical applications and promote trust in AI-based healthcare systems.
